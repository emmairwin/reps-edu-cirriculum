## Introduction

Mozilla Reps recognizes that our primary goals are best reached through the support, encouragement, and empowerment of community through mentorship. Mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, made possible through regular and supportive interaction.

We encourage mentors to be as open to learning from their mentees, as they are to teaching, for the benefit and growth of both individuals and the program as a whole.

Being a Mozilla Reps mentor also requires a familiarity with different tools and processes that the Council has put in place to better streamline the way Mozilla Reps can document their activities, request budgets for projects, order swag and interact with other Reps.

##  Training

We will be building out this  module based on Mentor Training WIki:  https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring-Training

## Badging

We will introduce the new Mozilla Reps Mentor Badge as recognition of completing training.
